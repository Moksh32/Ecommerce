=========

A PHP e-commerce web application.

1. To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
2. Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the bolt.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
4. The admin user which I have made has an email id admin and the password is admin. (Please confirm this in db or create one manually).
5. Open config.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database.
6. Once this is done, You're ready to run.

Enjoy!
